No Transform Values:
Transform values are only drawn in the following Tool modes: Move, Rotate, Scale, Rect, Transform

2 Number Key goes to 2D mode and overrides value entry fix:
Go to Edit >> Preferences >> Keys >> Scene View/Toggle 2D Mode and press the clear button.

Lag in scene view fix:
If your graphics card drivers are not up to date, Unity might lag in the scene view.
To find out if TransformInfo is the source of lag please open an empty project withouth it installed and see if the issue persists. 
If the tool is the cause of lag please submit a bug report at https://connect.unity.com/p/transform-info
